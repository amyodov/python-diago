DEPENDENCIES
============
For functioning, Diago requires the following:

* Python (tested with version 2.4.4; should work on higher 
  and may work on lower versions, but not tested).
  Get it at http://python.org, or by the means of your Unix/Linux 
  redistribution.
* python-dialog binding (tested with version 2.7). 
  Get it at http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net, or by the means of your
  Unix/Linux redistribution.

Highly recommended are also: 
* dialog tool (tested with version 1.1).
  Get it at http://invisible-island.net/dialog, or by the means of your
  Unix/Linux redistribution.
* xdialog tool (not tested at all, but likely works).
  Get it at http://xdialog.free.fr, or by the means of your Unix/Linux
  redistribution.
It is very likely that you need at least one of these; if you want to 
generate the menus, it will be one of these tools who are actually used. You
will use dialog to generate console-mode (ncurses-bases) menus (which are 
generated by default), or xdialog to generate graphical menus - but you WILL
have either one or two of them. And of course, you may have both tools 
installed, and they may be used simultaneously.

NOTE to package maintainers: this means that the diago package should DEPEND
on some meta-package provided by both dialog and xdialog, and dialog 
should be preferred (RECOMMENDED) to xdialog, but dialog and xdialog 
should not conflict with each other, and they must be able to be 
installed simultaneously.

It is suggested that you use also:
* expect interpreter / TCL extension (tested with version 5.43).
  Get it at http://expect.nist.gov, or by the means of your Unix/Linux
  redistribution.
Expect will be used each time when diago menu option contains 
an expect script. If there are no expect-options in any menus currently and
will never appear, expect interpreter is not required.

NOTE to package maintainers: this means that the diago package
should RECOMMEND installing expect package.


INSTALLATION
============
For installation, just copy go.py script to the directory you prefer to store
your executables/Python scripts. Usually this is something like /usr/local/bin, 
but it may be bin/ subdirectory of your home directory. 
If you want to execute it directly, ensure that this directory is listed in 
your PATH environment variable; otherwise create a link "go" (which refers 
to "go.py") in any directories among listed in your PATH. 
EXAMPLE (if you put the script in /usr/lib/python/diago/): 
  ln -s /usr/lib/python/diago/go.py /usr/local/bin/go

NOTE to package maintainers: put go.py where the Python scripts are stored 
according to your conventions (for example, /usr/lib/python/diago/go.py),
and make a symbolic link /usr/bin/go referring to it.


SETTING UP MENUS
================
After installation, you can create text files containing the menu structures,
to be used by Diago. You likely need to create at least one file, ".gorc" 
in your home directory, to be used by diago when executed without any other 
options. See README file for the details of the file structure, and examine 
the example.gorc file from the diago redistribution.
